👋 Hi there! My name is Victoria and I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo. In my free time, you can find me competing in hackathons, playing the piano, and volunteering as a moderator in the Codecademy Community. You can check out some of my past projects on my portfolio [here](https://victoriadarosa.dev).
